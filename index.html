      <p> Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Kyle Hlavaty. I was born and raised in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the eastern region of the state. After graduating from Liberty High School, I now find myself at the University of Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Campus. I am a brother and the Mental Health Chair of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, Gamma Sigma Chapter, and a member of Pitt Attacks Cancer Together (PACT). </p>

      <p> At the University of Pittsburgh I am currently studying Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry. My goal for the near future is to work within a cancer research lab after having family that was affected by the illness. Further education such as a masters or PhD is not out of the equation, but I am the type of person that takes life “one day at a time.” </p>

      <p> As a brother of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity, we all strive to be the best individual we can be. We host two fundraisers, The Big BENefit and Spring Spike, that benefit the Lymphoma society and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention respectively. When I am not busy with school or extracurriculars I spend my time with friends and family, watching sports, and cooking. </p>
