      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="/Static/Images/Me_1.jpeg" alt="Me" width="auto" height="100">
      <p> Hello all! My name is Kyle Hlavaty. I am from Bethlehem, PA located within the Lehigh Valley on the eastern side of the state. I am currently enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh –Pittsburgh Campus. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, cooking, and watching sports.</p>
         
      <p>My aim was discovered after losing both my mother and father to cancer before I turned 20. I am in my third year as an undergraduate student, studying Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry. I am determined to obtain a profession within cancer research to assist in treating the disease for others, and hopefully go on to receive a further education.</p>
      
      <p>I am a member and the “Mental Health Chair” of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity –Gamma Sigma Chapter.Our group runs two fundraisers throughout the school year. The first, The Big BENefit,benefits the Lymphoma society. The second, Spring Spike,is much largerandbenefits/raises awareness surrounding mental health through the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. In addition, I am in Pittsburgh Attacks Cancer Together (PACT)to raise money for cancer research. </p>
