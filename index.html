      <p> Hello all! My name is Kyle Hlavaty. I am from Bethlehem, PA located within the Lehigh Valley on the eastern side of the state. I am currently enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh –Pittsburgh Campus. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, cooking, and watching sports.</p>
         
      <p>My aim was discovered after losing both my mother and father to cancer before I turned 20. I am in my third year as an undergraduate student, studying Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry. I am determined to obtain a profession within cancer research to assist in treating the disease for others, and hopefully go on to receive a further education.</p>
      
      <p>I am a member and the “Mental Health Chair” of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity –Gamma Sigma Chapter.Our group runs two fundraisers throughout the school year. The first, The Big BENefit,benefits the Lymphoma society. The second, Spring Spike,is much largerandbenefits/raises awareness surrounding mental health through the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. In addition, I am in Pittsburgh Attacks Cancer Together (PACT)to raise money for cancer research. </p>
   
      <p> REVISED: </p>
      
      <p> Welcome to my page! My name is Kyle Hlavaty. I was born and raised in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the eastern region of the state. After graduating from Liberty High School, I now find myself at the University of Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh Campus. I am a brother and the Mental Health Chair of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, Gamma Sigma Chapter, and a member of Pitt Attacks Cancer Together (PACT). </p>

      <p> At the University of Pittsburgh I am currently studying Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry. My goal for the near future is to work within a cancer research lab after having family that was affected by the illness. Further education such as a masters or PhD is not out of the equation, but I am the type of person that takes life “one day at a time.” </p>

      <p> As a brother of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity, we all strive to be the best individual we can be. We host two fundraisers, The Big BENefit and Spring Spike, that benefit the Lymphoma society and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention respectively. When I am not busy with school or extracurriculars I spend my time with friends and family, watching sports, and cooking. </p>
