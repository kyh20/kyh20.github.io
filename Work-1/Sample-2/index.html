    <h2>Envisioning Your Design</h2>
    <p>The four pillars of web design (engaging, aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and impressive/memorable) can be defined in different ways depending on the intentions of the website’s author. In my opinion, any change to the design/layout of your website will affect at least two, if not more of the aforementioned categories. This being said, I believe making my design easy to use and navigate is the most important. To start, I will format site to be as straight-forward as I can. From here I plan to work to make it engaging by strongly considering the correct information, images, and diction to use in the body of the site. To make the design memorable, a strategic heading can be used. Additionally, I believe a short narrative describing yourself should be used, especially if you have an interesting background (Can be further enhanced by word choice). Finally, to make the design aesthetically pleasing, hopefully you are already satisfied with the format you developed earlier. By messing around with the color options you could make your site pleasing to view.The main idea of my Github website is for it to be used as an additional resource for employers to look at when I am applying to jobs in the near future. That being said, I intend to make my site one that sticks out, yet still portrays a professional, “I get things done,” ideology like we mentioned in class. I plan to format my design similar to the idea behind the https://www.cardamomandtea.com/design. The links to other pages could include, but are not limited to about me, education/experience, extracurriculars, research, and intent. I plan to avoid using  large images, and instead have a text consuming most of the page. I believe the “about me” page will bethe first to open on the site to make it more memorable, as well as engaging. The other pages will be selected after much thought in order to make the design as engaging as possible for a health care employer. Only information relevant to them will be included. Finally, the first color scheme that comes to mind for me is blue, white, and beige to keep it professional, while also making it more fun than a normal black and white page. I plan to have text in the center of the page, with small to medium sized images at the top. </p>
