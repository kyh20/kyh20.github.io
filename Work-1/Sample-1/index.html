    <p>Craigslist Product ReviewOver the summer, I decided to purchase two large metal drums in order to help my friend in constructing a smoker (for food). The seller was found in New Tripoli, Pennsylvania, which was essentially the middle of nowhere. This individual was a very nice, older man and even helped us load the 55-gallon drums onto the truck we had. Long story short, the smoker itself was a success, but the ozone surrounding our Earth took a hit. The seller failed to inform us that the drums were filled with oil. We intended to burn the drums to clean them originally but after opening the barrel,the aroma of oil filled the air around us. At this point my friends and I realized we simply had no choice. We had to destroy the environment. We burned the barrels at very high temperatures and completed the project, but knowing oil was in the barrel would have been beneficial for our cause and nature.  On the bright side, we now have a smokerand it works fairly well.</p>
