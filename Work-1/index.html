    <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
    <p> I have always considered myself fairly well-versed with technology. Coding HTML and CSS continues to test me, and has shown me just how tedious it can be. Similar to most projects I have completed, trial and error has been the most effective method for me to learn how these languages work. This has been applied to almost all facets of my growing github page (the design as well as the content itself).</p>
    <p> Coding my github site itself has caused me tons of frustration, but I am beginning to figure it out. What started as a white page with some text is growing into something that actually resembles a website. My total number of commits already exceeds 100. My technique has been to add something and if it did not work, change it. Fortunately, a few of my friends are computer science majors. As a last ditch effort to get a specific part of the code to work I would as for their assistance. Through this effort I was able to include all the content necessary, in addition to adding photos that relate to my writing.</p>
    <p> Being that I am attending the University of Pittsburgh to study Biological Sciences, the writing assignments in this class have been much different than the assignments I am used to completing. In fact, this reflection goes against all I have learned since I am never supposed to use the term “I” in my writing. To approach these assignments, in class I wrote whatever came to mind. I am not the best writer, so after class I took time to think about how I wanted to adjust the content for my site. </p>
    <p> To me, the most difficult assignment was the satirical craigslist product review. I chose this option and wrote about the smokers because it is a true story. I might have been asked to write a similar prompt only a handful of times. In my major I write strictly non-fiction, so this was a nice change. I made an attempt to revise the original version, but I am very inexperienced in this type of writing and hope to strengthen my ability to write like this. This assignment will likely be edited again before the end of the semester. </p>
    <p> The “about me” assignment was the first assignment I chose to revise. Most of the information I included from the first version was kept such as my hometown, what I am studying, my goals, and so on. The two pieces of information I chose to exclude in the revised version was my age and the fact that I lost my parents to cancer. Keeping my age out seemed obvious as I might not continue to update the site every year. I chose to keep the information about my parents out because I have stated I would like this site to be professional, and plan to update this site for job applications after this semester. In my opinion, it did not seem professional to include the fact about my parents as it appeals to emotions. I do not want a reader to think I was looking for sympathy, so saying that my family was affected by the illness felt more appropriate. </p>
    <p> The “envisioning your design” assignment was the second I chose to edit. After completing the in-class assignment using Daenaerys Targaryen as an example for a theme, I began to brainstorm individuals I look up to that I would like to use as my own theme. I am constantly listening to music, so I felt that a musician would be fitting for my theme. Although I rarely listen to P. Diddy (Sean Combs), he was the one I picked. Mr. Combs is one of the most successful people in the industry, carries himself with high regard, and dresses well. He is not only a musician, but also an entrepreneur, record executive, and actor. This activity helped me realize my page is likely to be content heavy, that will be continuously revised if I would like to use this for professional purposes. The design however, will eventually reach the point where I no longer want to adjust it for some time. P. Diddy’s music career has come to an end, which is symbolic of my final design. He continues to be involved in the industry through other means, resembling the content which will be updated. My original design concept is similar to the revised version, but by using an individual to base the design off I have a better idea of where I would like to go with the design. </p>
    <p> Although I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and how the two work together to produce a website, there is a lot more I would like to learn and introduce into my github page. My overall goal for this course is to be able to use these two languages efficiently, not requiring so many commits. The next feature I hope to edit is the menu. I would like to make the menu interactive. For example, I would like the menu to have a blue background that changes to a lighter blue when it is selected. I have also taken note that the upcoming lectures focus on photoshop. I have been able to include pictures on my page, but I would like to be able to crop and reshape them properly. I hope that this edit will increase the professional feel of the page. Another lecture I look forward to is the data visualization activity. There is no description to what this lecture will entail, but my hope is that it may relate to the data visualization I have done in my major. All in all, I am very pleased with the progress I have made in such a short amount of time.</p>
