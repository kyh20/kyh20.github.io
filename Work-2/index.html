    <h2>Work in Progress 2</h2>
    <p>Although the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our learning process here at Pitt, I am very thankful to have been introduced to Adobe’s Photoshop in this unit of Composing Digital Media. In my opinion, Photoshop is not an easy program to use. After continued use of the program, I have only just begun to grasp the possibilities that this photo editing software possesses. By dissecting each version of the assignments I have submitted, the progress of my learning is evident. </p>
    <p>Of the four activities we were tasked with (expectations, genre remix, storyboard, and custom logo), the first assignment consumed most of my time. Initially, I did not know where to begin when looking at the ads to remake. The ad I decided to use was a poster from the past for the main railroads being constructed in the United States. My goal was to reconstruct the poster to advertise Elon Musk’s Hyperloop. I started by clearing the original company name and logos. This was completed by using the “eyedropper tool,” then painting over the area with that color. This allowed me to place Tesla and SpaceX titles and logos in their place. I used this same technique to update the names of cities the Hyperloop would connect and the adjectives used at the top of the advertisement. After this was completed, I realized using the names and logos of two established companies may or may not be violating some copyright rules. Out of precaution I decided to edit the logos and names so that they are completely unrelated to Mr. Musk’s businesses. The current Hyperloop parody added to my site still contains the image used in the original poster. To complete my version of the ad, I hope to clear this image using the same method I previously mentioned. The open space will be filled with an updated image of a futuristic train.</p>
    <p>The second sample of my photoshop work is the group movie genre remix. Our group was required to select a romantic comedy movie advertisement, then redesign it to appear as a disaster movie. The Proposal starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds was picked. I began by editing both Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds out of the background to make them a separate layer. This allowed me to find the image of a wildfire for a new background. Due to enlarging the image of the fire, its quality was affected. I attempted to resolve this issue by using the “sharpening tool” for a more high-definition look. Our group continued to brainstorm possible disasters to include in the remake. We decided to cut and paste copies of a baby into the image because to us (four college students) a child would be considered a disaster. One edit I would like to consider in the final product is replacing both actors' figures. Bullock and Reynolds have both starred in disaster movies throughout their career. Introducing an action shot of each individual would increase the disastrous feel of the advertisement.</p>
    <p>The storyboard activity is the third classwork sample in this unit. I used this task to begin to organize the pecha kucha I will deliver later in the course on readability. By using the templates provided, I was able to begin to establish the spatial orientation of the slides for my presentation. Additionally, I was able to give a brief description of my aim when speaking about each slide. These tasks were completed by using the “text tool” or the “brush tool.” For my final submission, I hope to complete the storyboard. The finished product will not include all details from my entire presentation, but by completing the storyboard I will have established a target for the presentation itself.</p>
    <p>The final classwork sample is the logo. In my personal introduction on the front page of my site, I mentioned that I hope to run my own research in the future. I quickly decided to attempt to create a logo for my own fictional research lab. In the logo you can see that the H and L of “Hlavaty Labs” are connected. All companies have a smaller/alternate logo to use at the top of websites or on app icons. This was my attempt of creating my own. Because my logo is related to a research lab, I added circles to the H and L to resemble bubbles in a chemical reaction. During this edit I spent a lot of time trying to get the “dissolve” effect to work how I wished. I was unable to understand how to control the design effect. This will be worked on for the final submission. Furthermore, I plan to edit the remainder of the logo apart from the H and L. A specific example I thought of was replacing both A’s in my last name to beakers. Finally, I was able to successfully add an additional menu item for the progress checklist. As of right now this list is very bland as I have struggled to edit the design of the table using the CSS file. In my final submission the table's rows and columns will be edited to make it easier to read.</p>
    <p> Overall I am appreciative of the work I have done in Adobe’s Photoshop, but I am not satisfied with the final products. To me, the logo activity is the most relevant to the continuation of my website. The smaller logo design I mentioned could be used at the top left of each page for my site. This design would be implemented through the CSS file. As I stated in the previous reflection I would still like to edit the menu and overall design of my site.</p>
