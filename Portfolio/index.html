       <p>Personally, I believe revision is simply the term used to define the action of an individual learning from their own, or someone else’s mistakes. Composing Digital Media has been divided into three different subunits - Web Design, Photo Editing, and Audio Editing. For me, each unit brought about its own unique revisions that stemmed from a different target or targets. In web design, I believe my target audience and context played the largest role in how I approached editing my material. In both the photo and audio editing units I found that audience and purpose influenced my work heavily. Although these are the same two pillars, they led to different revisions in each assignment/unit.</p>
        <p>The “about me” task, as well as two classwork samples during the introduction to web design unit are products of my target audience and context. Upon completing my pecha kucha on readability in design, I began to understand the effect that these two pillars had on my work. The about me assignment was the first task of this course, as well as the first I chose to revise. This passage can be found on the front page of my website. It is essentially my first impression on anyone who views this site. Therefore, I set my goal of my text to be able to tell about my current life, ambitions, goals, and so on, while trying to leave a lasting impression on my target audience. In this situation, I saw my target audience as potential employers which gave the situation the corresponding context. This had a major effect on my word choice and sentence structure in order to maintain the appropriate readability level. In addition, my choice of who my target audience was directly affected the content I included in my work. My revised approach to the assignment was less personal in order to appeal to the professional side of this imaginary spectrum I am building.</p>
        <p> Throughout the second unit of the course, I found that my audience and purpose had the greatest influence on my goals while completing the photo editing assignments. Although all assignments were similar in nature, my target audience and purpose varied from one to another. In the first photoshop assignment I began by considering how to make a parody ad for the idea of a hyperloop. Considering that I was constructing an advertisement, I had to consider two target audiences (the public and a boss) as well as the purpose to spread the news about a hyperloop. As stated by Ledwell, “Reading gravity pulls the eyes from top-left to the bottom-right” to establish the Gutenberg Diagram. In order to meet the needs of both audiences as well as the purpose of the hyperloop advertisement, I used the primary optical area and strong fallow areas to emphasize the name of the construction as well as company titles. Entering the weak fallow area and terminal area you will notice details about the hyperloop as well as credits to other sources. Critical information was included at the top of the poster so that viewers have a better chance to acknowledge/remember it while the “boss” would be glad to see his company’s information front and center. The movie genre remix is another assignment that displays how audience and purpose affected my decisions. As a group we were tasked with converting a romantic comedy to a disaster movie. The conversion of genre meant that the target audience from the original movie advertisement has been changed entirely. The difference in the advertisements is clear. A white background changed to a raging fire and crying babies were introduced at the bottom of the poster. In my opinion, the movie had been changed to target teenagers and young adults over the typical “rom com” fan. </p>
        <p> My target audience and purpose continued to play a vital role in my decision making in the audio unit. In making the soundscape activity, I found the activity to be rather therapeutic as I messed around on audacity to introduce myself to the program. This realization came a few weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Taking these factors into consideration, I believe my target audience was to all those currently self-isolating while my purpose was to create an image of a beach in their minds to develop a sense of normality. I began this assignment by locating various sounds you could experience on a beach. Before introducing them into the same audio file, I edited each in various ways (Fade in/out, amplify, soften, etc.) until I was satisfied with the product. After including them all into the audio file, I revised my original edits of each piece of audio. This involved editing the timing, volume, and more of each sound to construct a fluid final product. I hope that anyone who views the file could close their eyes to imagine themselves on the beach with waves, seagulls, children, whatever might trigger a good memory from the past. </p>
        <p> Overall, I believe that composing digital media has given me a single skill which can be broken down into many “subgroups.” I feel that most writing assignments I am tasked with are completed with the idea that there is a specific prompt which must be fulfilled to suit the needs of my professor. This class behaved in a similar way, but the prompts allowed us as the individual to construct an audience and purpose rather. Because of this I have a better understanding of how all work is affected by an individual’s thought process. Although my peers may have had similar ideas and goals when completing an assignment, they may have executed it in an entirely different way. Similarly, two people writing for the same genre may prioritize different features within that genre. I believe these are two valuable realizations for the work I will complete in the future. After completion of this class, I plan to continue teaching myself the different forms of web design. Not only do I plan to develop an appealing website, but the skills may come into use in my future profession </p>
        <h2> Showcase </h2>
        <p> Soundscape Activity </p>
        <p> The soundscape activity is an assignment I am particularly proud of. Once again, I had no experience in audio editing other than limited interactions with garageband as a student in grade-school. Additionally, as I stated in my final reflection, I used this assignment as an escape from the current events with the Coronavirus. I edited each audio file on its own based on an experience at the beach from my past in hopes that others who listen to it will also be brought back to certain times in their lives. An example for me is that I attempted to create the sounds of two people playing catch with a baseball (I played for 15 years up until college). Two specific edits that gave me trouble are included in the plane and seagull clips. I spent time trying to edit them so that the audio transitioned from the left to the right.</p>
        <p> 1.) An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience.

        <p> </p>
        <p> To me, the most direct example of how I made decisions based on genre and audience took place during the group assignment, genre remix. For this task my group was assigned to convert a romantic comedy movie advertisement to a disaster movie. The original advertisement for, “The Proposal,” was very basic. An all white background with the two characters (one holding a ring) is meant to appeal to the group of people who are interested in romantic comedies. We converted this ad by adding a wild fire in the background, bold lettering for character names, and crying babies. The genre change itself shifted our target audience to a younger group who enjoys the destruction. Taking our new audience and genre into consideration allowed us to develop the appropriate ad for the group.</p>
    <p> 2.) An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode.

        <p> </p>
        <p> When it came to considering my choice of color, fonts, scale, and more in terms of the visual mode, the logo project is a great example. For this assignment I chose to make a logo for a lab under my name. It started with me considering the focal point of the logo. I decided to make the H/L portion connected to establish this. Because the logo was meant for a scientific laboratory, I chose to include white bubbles to make it appear as though there is a carbonated liquid inside the lettering. From there I chose to include the rest of the logo to create “Hlavaty Labs.” Here I chose to include a professional style font because I believe that is the only appropriate style to go with. Finally, I chose to include a gradient of blue to purple (darker colors) to keep the entire logo in common ground between being too boring and too flashy.</p>
